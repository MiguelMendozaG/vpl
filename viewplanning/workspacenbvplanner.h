/**
 * Planner that computes the NBV as a pose (x,y,z,yaw,pitch,roll)
 * In particular, this implemented object generates a view sphere and selects the NBV as the view with the highest evaluation depending on the partial model selected
 * 
 * At initialization:
 * 	It generates a view sphere assuming a freeflyer robot which is pointing to the x axis and z is upward
 * 	The view sphere is taken as configurations of the robot, then It asks to the robot to return the end effector pose and HTM
 *      The list of candidateViews is created
 * 
 * For NBV computation:
 * 	It queries to the partial model to evaluate the pointed views
